                            <p >Presidents of four district associations of the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) on Monday made allegation of irregularities against the current leadership of the football governing body. Kathmandu FC President Birat Jung Shahi, Bhaktapur FA President Gautam Sujhaku, Dhading President Dipak Khatiwada and Lalitpur President Purusottam Thapa outlined a 14-point irregularities since Karma Tshering Sherpa was elected at the helm of ANFA in May. They demanded probe of the irregularities and misconduct from the National Sports Council (NSC) and Ministry of Youth and Sports (MoYS). Dhading President Khatiwada alleged Sherpa leadership of sending ‘foreign citizen’ Nabin Pande as Nepal’s representative at the FIFA Congress in Russia in June. Pande, a German citizen, was one of the representatives of Nepal along with Sherpa in the FIFA Congress. hey also questioned the murky dealing in the sales of 2018 FIFA World Cup tickets by ANFA, reluctance in implementing financial regulations approved by the ANFA Congress, haphazardly distributing allowances and irregularities in renovation and reconstruction of ANFA office. “The current leadership has been undergoing renovating and furnishing work of ANFA office with a hefty amount of Rs 30 million,” said Khatiwada. “In the first place, they have not followed the established norms while undertaking the project. Secondly, the structure was in good shape and did not require maintenance. They should have channelled the money instead to the development of the game itself,” said Khatiwada. Khatiwada also alleged ANFA of misleading the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) by demanding more budget than actually required while conducting the AFC tournament (AFC U-16 Women Championship Qualifier). Khatiwada  claimed that ANFA produced fake documents to make it happen. He also criticised ANFA for needlessly sending vice presidents at a FIFA seminar instead of national team head coach and technical director in London in September. Khatiwada also questioned ANFA’s professionalism by depositing money meant for District FAs into the personal accounts of the respective presidents. “We will report all these cases to the AFC and seek strict action,” said Khatiwada adding that they had earlier submitted evidences of misconduct during the ANFA election to the NSC, MoYS and AFC.</p>

                                    <p>Kathmandu Cricket Training Centre (KCTC) on Saturday marked its 10th anniversary amidst a programme in Kathmandu. Situated in Sanepa, KCTC has continuously provided training to numerous aspiring cricketers who have gone on to play for the age group national teams of the country. The anniversary was marked by organising different programmes with the involvement of parents and KCTC students. KCTC is currently providing training to more than 100 students through different sessions. National cricket team vice-captain Gyanendra Malla, who is the KCTC director, said now it was time to make the organisation bigger. “We never thought of going this long way because there were times when we were forced to make a decision to close it. But thankfully, we got support from different people including the land owner where we are currently hold the net sessions,” Malla said during the programme. “The academy is getting bigger day by day and many students have shown up to join the game which I think is a positive sign in the development of the cricket in the country.” “We have always wanted to have a hostel which would take care of the players and get them involved in daily studies as well. I don’t know how far we can go but the plan is have a cricket school and hopefully we can reach there someday,” added Malla who recently led Lalitpur Patriots to the Everest Premier League title.</p>

                                    <p>Sudur Paschim XI Sports Club has signed title sponsorship deal with Nepal Ice of Chaudhary Group for the third International Invitational Sudur Paschim Khaptad Gold Cup football tournament. The knock out event is scheduled to be held in Dhangadhi from January 8-19. Club President Suresh Hamal and CG Brewery senior general manager Pradip Pudasaini signed the deal during a programme in Kathmandu. The complete financial deal between the two parties was not disclosed, while the tournament will continue to be named as Nepal Ice Sudur Paschim Khaptad Gold Cup. “CG has supported us generously but we have agreed not to disclose the sponsorship amount,” said Hamal adding that the club had initiated to start the tournament as the Far-west was the only region of the country which did not have single top level tournament in. “We founded Sudhur Paschim XI Sports Club three years back and have been working to contribute in the development of the game,” he said. Pudasaini believed his company had reasons to be associated with the event. “The tournament has played special role in the development of football and sports as a whole in the whole Far West Region. It is matter of pride for CG to get associated with it. We will give continuity to the partnership in future as well,” said Pudasaini. The tournament will feature 12 teams including Three Star Club, Nepal Police Club, Sankata Club, Nepal APF Club, Chyasal Youth Club, Gorkha Boys (Rupandehi), Kakadbhitta Football Training Center (Jhapa) and hosts Sudur Paschim XI with Delhi United of India as the only foreign invitee. “We are in talks with Martyrs Memorial ‘A’ Division League champions Manang Marshyangdi Club (MMC) and they will confirm about their participation in few days,” informed club general secretary Prakash Shahi. “The remaining two teams will also be confirmed shortly.” The tournament will be without defending champions Tribhuvan Army Club as they were handed a ban by the organisers. “Army players had manhandled our players during Sarlahai Gold Cup final last year. So we have decided not to include them for one-year as a disciplinary action against them,” he added. Shahi boasted that his club has not only formed the club but also recruited players on round-the-year basis. “We had competed in 10 knock out football tournaments across the country last year,” he said. The tournament will also be highest cash-prized domestic knockout event with the winners walking away with a purse of Rs 2.1 million and the runners up taking home Rs 1 million. The best player will ride a two wheeler. Best players in four difference positions—goalkeeping, midfield, defense and forward—will get Rs 15,000 apiece. The man-of-the-match of each game will get Rs 10,000 each. The expected cost of the event is Rs 14 million.</p></div>

	                <p><span class="bold">Looking forward to a safer year for journalists</span><br>
As news headlines across the world have shown, 2018 delivered major blows to truth and justice. But this was especially true for the people who write the headlines. From Saudi Arabia to Sarlahi, journalists experienced a year of peril, violence, and abuse. According to the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), 94 journalists and media workers died in targeted killings, bomb attacks and crossfire incidents this year—a significant increase from 2017. Article 19, a human rights organisation, also reported that journalism is more dangerous and under more threat than any point in the last decade. 
Here in Nepal, the environment for free and safe journalism also considerably shrank in 2018. The Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ Nepal) reported that there have been 42 incidents of abuse against journalists from May 4th, 2018. Reports from IFEX Nepal detail too many cases—each peppered with violent and abusive details—to fit in an editorial column but here are two: In June, five journalists were attacked by Nepal police officers while they were covering clashes between the police and demonstrators near the parliament in Kathmandu. 
In November, a dozen cadres of ruling the Nepal Communist Party attacked journalist Lokendra Khanal of Nagarik daily in Rukum district in West Nepal. Police made no arrests in connection with the case. Other cases of unwarranted arrests, threatening phone calls, and online abuse of journalists in the country occur so frequently that they often go unreported.
Various legislative measures taken in 2018 to curtail press freedoms have only made matters worse. The new Criminal Code, which came into effect in August 2018, included a number of articles that many human rights agencies claim will severely hinder the ability of journalists to engage in free and fair reporting. Prime Minister KP Oli’s repeated rhetorical attacks towards journalists have also contributed to global narratives that have attempted to categorise journalists as ‘enemies of the people’. 
Journalism as an institution is of utmost importance to democracy and human rights. For democracy to be healthy, we need a healthy press. With more than 90 deaths worldwide, voices have clearly been suppressed, fear has been spread and the people’s right to know the truth has been taken away from them. Through journalism, the citizenry forms decisions about their lives, communities and the government at large. 
With this regressive momentum, 2019 looks bleak for press freedom. Intervention is urgently needed. As Robert Shaw, the Global Safety Programme Manager at International Media Support, said earlier this year, ‘this is the right time for Nepal to set up a mechanism for protecting journalists taking into account the three P’s—prevention, protection and prosecution.’ 
To counter this growing culture of censorship, journalists should continue to advocate for the revision of vaguely-worded clauses, report cases of abuse—especially from the government, and continue tackling difficult investigative stories.

The article (‘Ex-UN Official in Nepal to discuss transitional justice issues’, TKP Online, 21 December, 2018) is based on the Post’s interview with a number of individuals who met with Ian Martin in Kathmandu, and told the Post that Mr. Martin was not happy with the ongoing transitional justice process and was particularly disappointed that it didn’t follow the spirit of the Comprehensive Peace Accord.

Your story (‘Ex-UN official in Nepal to discuss transitional justice issues’, TKP Online, 21 December, 2018) completely misrepresents a short personal visit I had thepleasure to make to Kathmandu, and is riddled with falsehoods.

This is in reference to a news story entitled (‘Here’s everything you need to know about Nepal Airlines’ Airbus deal’, TKP online, December 7). Connecting my appointment as managing director of Nepal Airlines on May 31, 2015 with the purchase of two wide-body Airbus A330 aircraft, which was purchased after international competitive bidding participated in by 11 companies from six countries, is far-fetched.
